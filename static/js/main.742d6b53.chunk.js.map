and that I am equally interested in diseases and people; perhaps, too, that I am equally, if inadequately, a theorist and dramatist, am equally drawn to the scientific and the romantic, and continually see both in the human condition, not least in that quintessential human condition of sickness-animals get diseases, but only man falls radically into sickness. \\n\" +\n    \"\\n\" +\n    \"My work, my life, is all with the sick-but the sick and their sickness drives me to thoughts which, perhaps, I might otherwise not have. So much so that I am compelled to ask, with Nietzsche: As for sickness: are we not almost tempted to ask whether we could get along without it?-and to see the questions it raises as fundamental in nature. Constantly my patients drive me to question, and constantly my questions drive me to patients-thus in the stories or studies which follow there is a continual movement from one to the other. \\n\" +\n    \"\\n\" +\n    \"Studies, yes; why stories, or cases? Hippocrates introduced the historical conception of disease, the idea that diseases have a course, from their first intimations to their climax or crisis, and thence to their happy or fatal resolution. Hippocrates thus introduced the case history, a description, or depiction, of the natural history of disease-precisely expressed by the old word pathology. Such histories are a form of natural history-but they tell us nothing about the individual and his history; they convey nothing of the person, and the experience of the person, as he faces, and struggles to survive, his disease. There is no subject in a narrow case history; modern case histories allude to the subject in a cursory phrase (a trisomic albino female of 21), which could as well apply to a rat as a human being. To restore the human subject at the centre-the suffering, afflicted, fighting, human subject-we must deepen a case history to a narrative or tale; only then do we have a who as well as a what, a real person, a patient, in relation to disease-in relation to the physical. \\n\" +\n    \"\\n\" +\n    \"The patient's essential being is very relevant in the higher reaches of neurology, and in psychology; for here the patient's personhood is essentially involved, and the study of disease and of identity cannot be disjoined. Such disorders, and their depiction and study, indeed entail a new discipline, which we may call the neurology of identity, for it deals with the neural foundations of the self, the age-old problem of mind and brain. It is possible that there must, of necessity, be a gulf, a gulf of category, between the psychical and the physical; but studies and stories pertaining simultaneously and inseparably to both-and it is these which especially fascinate me, and which (on the whole) I present here-may nonetheless serve to bring them nearer, to bring us to the very intersection of mechanism and life, to the relation of psychological processes to biography. \\n\" +\n    \"\\n\" +\n    \"The tradition of richly human clinical tales reached a high point in the nineteenth century, and then declined, with the advent of an impersonal neurological science. Luria wrote: The power to describe, which was so common to the great nineteenth-century neurologists and psychiatrists, is almost gone now. It must be revived. His own late works, such as the Mind of a Mnemonist and The Man with a Shattered World, are attempts to revive this lost tradition. Thus the case-histories in this book hark back to an ancient tradition: to the nineteenth-century tradition of which Luria speaks; to the tradition of the first medical historian, Hippocrates; and to that universal and prehistorical tradition by which patients have always told their stories to doctors.\";\n\n\n// MCAT Article 2\nvar test_string9 =\"( Root (span 1 81)( Nucleus (span 1 23) (rel2par

reaches farmers in Peru</h1></div> <div>  <p>A network of community computer centres, linked by wireless technology, is providing a helping hand for poor farmers in Peru.</p>  </div>  <div>     <p>The pilot scheme in the Huaral Valley, 80 kilometres north of the capital Lima, aims to offer the 6,000-strong community up-to-date information on agricultural market prices and trends. The Agricultural Information Project for Farmers of the Chancay-Huaral Valley also provides vital links between local organisations in charge of water irrigation, enabling them to coordinate their actions. More than 13,000 rural inhabitants, as well as 18,000 students in the region, will also benefit from the telecoms infrastructure.</p></div><div><p>            The 14 telecentres uses only free open source software and affordable computer equipment. The network has been three years in the making and was officially inaugurated in September.</p></div> <div><p>            The non-government organisation, Cepes (Peruvian Centre for Social Studies) led the $200,000 project, also backed by local institutions, the Education and Agriculture ministries, and European development organisations. The plan includes training on computers and internet skills for both operators and users of the system, said Carlos Saldarriaga, technical coordinator at Cepes. Farmers are also taking extra lessons on how to apply the new information to make the most of their plots of land. The Board of Irrigation Users which runs the computer centres, aims to make the network self-sustainable within three years, through the cash generated by using the telecentres as internet cafes.</p></div><div><p>            One of the key elements of the project is the Agricultural Information System, with its flagship huaral.org website. There, farmers can find the prices for local produce, as well as information on topics ranging from plague prevention to the latest farming techniques. The system also helps the inhabitants of the Chancay-Huaral Valley to organise their vital irrigation systems. Water is the main element that unites them all. It is a precious element in Peru's coastal areas, because it is so scarce, and therefore it is necessary to have proper irrigation systems to make the most of it, Mr Saldarriaga told the BBC News website. The information network also allows farmers to look beyond their own region, and share experiences with other colleagues from the rest of Peru and even around the world.</p></div> <div><p>        Cepes says the involvement of the farmers has been key in the project's success. Throughout the last three years, the people have provided a vital thrust to the project; they feel it belongs to them, said Mr Saldarriaga. The community training sessions, attended by an equal number of men and women, have been the perfect showcase for their enthusiasm. We have had an excellent response, mainly from young people. But we have also had a great feedback when we trained 40 or 50-year old women, who were seeing a computer for the first time in their lives. So far, the Huaral programme promoters say the experience has been very positive, and are already planning on spreading the model among other farmers' organisations in Peru. This is a pilot project, and we have been very keen on its cloning potential in other places, underlined Mr Saldarriaga.</p></div><div><p>The Cepes researcher recalls what happened in Cuyo, a 50-family community with no electricity, during the construction of the local telecentre site. There it was necessary to build a mini-hydraulic dam in order to generate 2kW worth of power for the computers, the communications equipment and the cabin lights. It was already dark when the technicians realised they didn't have any light bulbs to test the generator, so they turned up to the local store to buy light bulbs, recalls Carlos Saldarriaga. The logical answer was 'we don't sell any', so they had to wait until the next morning to do the testing. Now, with the wireless network, Cuyo as well as the other communities is no longer isolated.</p></div> </div>\"};\n\n\nvar title7 = \"Levy takes Whitbread novel prize\";\nvar raw7 = \"Levy takes Whitbread novel prize\\n\" +\n    \"{<br>}\" +\n    \"Orange Prize winner Andrea Levy has seen her book Small Island win the Whitbread Novel of the Year Award.\\n\" +\n    \"\\n\" +\n    \"She is now favourite to win the overall prize after beating Booker winner Alan Hollinghurst's The Line of Beauty.

All the category winners go through to compete for the Whitbread Book of the Year title, which carries with it a £25,000 prize.

One is a Jamaican who joined British troops to fight Hitler but finds life difficult out of uniform when he settles in London. The judges, who included authors Jenny Colgan and Amanda Craig, were full of praise for her writing. What could have been a didactic or preachy prospect turns out to hilarious, moving humane and eye-popping. It's hard to think of anybody not enjoying it, wrote the judges. The first novel section was won by Susan Fletcher for Eve Green, beating the favourite Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell by Susanna Clarke. Fletcher has recently graduated from graduated from the University of East Anglia creative writing course.

The Agricultural Information Project for Farmers of the Chancay-Huaral Valley also provides vital links between local organisations in charge of water irrigation, enabling them to coordinate their actions. More than 13,000 rural inhabitants, as well as 18,000 students in the region, will also benefit from the telecoms infrastructure.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n        <div><p>            The 14 telecentres uses only free open source software and affordable computer equipment. The network has been three years in the making and was officially inaugurated in September.\n        </p></div>\n\n        <div><p>            The non-government organisation, Cepes (Peruvian Centre for Social Studies) led the $200,000 project, also backed by local institutions, the Education and Agriculture ministries, and European development organisations. The plan includes training on computers and internet skills for both operators and users of the system, said Carlos Saldarriaga, technical coordinator at Cepes. Farmers are also taking extra lessons on how to apply the new information to make the most of their plots of land. The Board of Irrigation Users which runs the computer centres, aims to make the network self-sustainable within three years, through the cash generated by using the telecentres as internet cafes.\n        </p></div>\n        <div><p>            One of the key elements of the project is the Agricultural Information System, with its flagship huaral.org website. There, farmers can find the prices for local produce, as well as information on topics ranging from plague prevention to the latest farming techniques. The system also helps the inhabitants of the Chancay-Huaral Valley to organise their vital irrigation systems. Water is the main element that unites them all. It is a precious element in Peru's coastal areas, because it is so scarce, and therefore it is necessary to have proper irrigation systems to make the most of it, Mr Saldarriaga told the BBC News website. The information network also allows farmers to look beyond their own region, and share experiences with other colleagues from the rest of Peru and even around the world.\n        </p></div>\n        <div><p>        Cepes says the involvement of the farmers has been key in the project's success. Throughout the last three years, the people have provided a vital thrust to the project; they feel it belongs to them, said Mr Saldarriaga. The community training sessions, attended by an equal number of men and women, have been the perfect showcase for their enthusiasm. We have had an excellent response, mainly from young people. But we have also had a great feedback when we trained 40 or 50-year old women, who were seeing a computer for the first time in their lives. So far, the Huaral programme promoters say the experience has been very positive, and are already planning on spreading the model among other farmers' organisations in Peru. This is a pilot project, and we have been very keen on its cloning potential in other places, underlined Mr Saldarriaga.\n        </p></div>\n        <div><p>\n            The Cepes researcher recalls what happened in Cuyo, a 50-family community with no electricity, during the construction of the local telecentre site. There it was necessary to build a mini-hydraulic dam in order to generate 2kW worth of power for the computers, the communications equipment and the cabin lights. It was already dark when the technicians realised they didn't have any light bulbs to test the generator, so they turned up to the local store to buy light bulbs, recalls Carlos Saldarriaga. The logical answer was 'we don't sell any', so they had to wait until the next morning to do the testing. Now, with the wireless network, Cuyo as well as the other communities is no longer isolated.\n        </p></div>\n    </div>);\n}\n\nvar LevyTitle = \"Levy takes Whitbread novel prize\";\n\nfunction rawLevy() {\n    return (<div>\n        <div><h1>Levy takes Whitbread novel prize</h1></div>\n        <div><p>Orange Prize winner Andrea Levy has seen her book Small Island win the Whitbread Novel of the Year Award.</p></div>\n            <div><p>She is now favourite to win the overall prize after beating Booker winner Alan Hollinghurst's The Line of Beauty.

So much so that I am compelled to ask, with Nietzsche: As for sickness: are we not almost tempted to ask whether we could get along without it?-and to see the questions it raises as fundamental in nature. Constantly my patients drive me to question, and constantly my questions drive me to patients-thus in the stories or studies which follow there is a continual movement from one to the other.</div></p>\n\n            <p><div>Studies, yes; why stories, or cases? Hippocrates introduced the historical conception of disease, the idea that diseases have a course, from their first intimations to their climax or crisis, and thence to their happy or fatal resolution. Hippocrates thus introduced the case history, a description, or depiction, of the natural history of disease-precisely expressed by the old word pathology. Such histories are a form of natural history-but they tell us nothing about the individual and his history; they convey nothing of the person, and the experience of the person, as he faces, and struggles to survive, his disease. There is no subject in a narrow case history; modern case histories allude to the subject in a cursory phrase (a trisomic albino female of 21), which could as well apply to a rat as a human being. To restore the human subject at the centre-the suffering, afflicted, fighting, human subject-we must deepen a case history to a narrative or tale; only then do we have a who as well as a what, a real person, a patient, in relation to disease-in relation to the physical.</div></p>\n\n            <p><div>The patient's essential being is very relevant in the higher reaches of neurology, and in psychology; for here the patient's personhood is essentially involved, and the study of disease and of identity cannot be disjoined. Such disorders, and their depiction and study, indeed entail a new discipline, which we may call the neurology of identity, for it deals with the neural foundations of the self, the age-old problem of mind and brain. It is possible that there must, of necessity, be a gulf, a gulf of category, between the psychical and the physical; but studies and stories pertaining simultaneously and inseparably to both-and it is these which especially fascinate me, and which (on the whole) I present here-may nonetheless serve to bring them nearer, to bring us to the very intersection of mechanism and life, to the relation of psychological processes to biography.</div></p>\n\n            <p><div> The tradition of richly human clinical tales reached a high point in the nineteenth century, and then declined, with the advent of an impersonal neurological science. Luria wrote: The power to describe, which was so common to the great nineteenth-century neurologists and psychiatrists, is almost gone now. It must be revived. His own late works, such as the Mind of a Mnemonist and The Man with a Shattered World, are attempts to revive this lost tradition. Thus the case-histories in this book hark back to an ancient tradition: to the nineteenth-century tradition of which Luria speaks; to the tradition of the first medical historian, Hippocrates; and to that universal and prehistorical tradition by which patients have always told their stories to doctors.</div></p>\n        </div>)\n}\n\n// Happy american\nfunction mcat2() {\n    return (\n        <div>\n            <div><h1>The Happy American</h1></div>\n            <div><p>Americans are a positive people. This is their reputation as well as their self-image. In the well-worn stereotype, they are upbeat, cheerful, and optimistic.</p></div>\n            <div><p>Who would be churlish enough to challenge these happy features of the American personality? Take the business of positive affect, which refers to the mood they display to others through their smiles, their greetings, their professions of confidence and optimism. Scientists have found that the mere act of smiling can generate positive feelings within us, at least if the smile is not forced. In addition, recent studies show that happy feelings flit easily through social networks, so that one person's good fortune can brighten the day even for only distantly connected others. Furthermore, psychologists agree that positive feelings can actually lengthen our lives and improve our health. People who report having positive feelings are more likely to participate in a rich social life, and social connectedness turns out to be an important defense against depression, which is a known risk factor for many physical illnesses.</p></div>\n            <div><p>It is a sign of progress, then, that economists have begun to show an interest in using happiness rather than just the gross national product as a measure of an economy's success. Happiness is, of course, a slippery thing to measure or define. Philosophers have debated what it is for centuries, and even if they were to define it simply as a greater frequency of positive feelings than negative ones, when they ask people if they are happy, they are asking them to arrive at some sort of average over many moods and moments.</p></div>\n            <div><p>Surprisingly, when psychologists measure the relative happiness of nations, they routinely find that Americans are not, even in prosperous times and despite their vaunted positivity, very happy at all. A recent meta-analysis of over a hundred studies of self-reported happiness worldwide found Americans ranking only twenty-third. Americans account for two-thirds of the global market for antidepressants, which happen also to be the most commonly prescribed drugs in the United States.</p></div>\n            <div><p>How can Americans be so surpassingly positive in self-image and stereotype without being the world's happiest and best-off people? The answer is that positivity is not so much their condition as it is part of their ideology-the way they explain the world and think they ought to function within it. That ideology is positive thinking, by which they usually mean two things. One is the generic content of positive thinking-that is, the positive thought itself-which can be summarized as Things are pretty good right now, at least if you are willing to see silver linings, make lemonade out of lemons, etc., and things are going to get a whole lot better.</p></div>\n            <div><p>The second thing they mean by positive thinking is this practice of trying to think in a positive way. There is, they are told, a practical reason for undertaking this effort: positive thinking supposedly not only makes us feel optimistic but actually makes happy outcomes more likely. How can the mere process of thinking do this? In the rational explanation that many psychologists would offer today, optimism improves health, personal efficacy, confidence, and resilience, making it easier for us to accomplish our goals. A far less rational theory also runs rampant in American ideology-the idea that our thoughts can, in some mysterious way, directly affect the physical world. Negative thoughts somehow produce negative outcomes, while positive thoughts realize themselves in the form of health, prosperity, and success. For both rational and mystical reasons, then, the effort of positive thinking is said to be well worth our time and attention.</p></div>\n        </div>);\n}\n\nvar mcat2_title = \"The Happy American\";\n\n// SET ALL THE INFO HERE\n// Blump\n// Title options: LevyTitle, peruTitle, noTitle, mcat2_title\n// Body: rawLevy(), rawPeru(), mcat2()\nvar noTitle = \"Passage 1\";\nvar exampleTitle = \"Example Passage\";\n\nvar articleTitle = peruTitle;\n\nfunction bodyText() {\n    return rawPeru();\n}\n\n\nclass InstructionSteps extends React.Component {\n    render() {\n        return(\n            <div>\n            <h1>RAR: RST Augmented Reader</h1>\n                <div>\n                    <p>RAR is an online text reader that leverages <b>Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST)</b> to augment reading comprehension.\n                RST is a linguistic theory that explains coherence (what makes sentences actually have meaning) by postulating a\n                        hierachical, connected, text structure (<a href=\"https://www.sfu.ca/~mtaboada/docs/publications/Taboada_Mann_RST_Part1.pdf\"><i>Mann, 2006</i></a>).\n                    RST postulates that all meaningful text can be represented by a tree structure in which sentences are assigned a specific function in relation\n                    to the rest of the text.
